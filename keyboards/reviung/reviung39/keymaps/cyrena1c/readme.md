# cy's comfy 39-keymap

Keymap designed specifically for  C/C++ coding on reviung39.   Uses combos in
addition to layers.  Mod-taps Ctrl to Esc (next to A) and Alt to Tab (next to
Q.) Lower+Tab behaves just like Alt+Tab in many platforms.

A  mouse emulation layer  is also available.   Mouse+/  locks the mouse layer
until  Mouse+/  or  any left-half alpha key is pressed.   Mouse lock does not
apply to RGB adjust and Reset key.
